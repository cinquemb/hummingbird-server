The fabric first appeared around 1830, but by 1850 the word had come to mean a stiffened petticoat or rigid skirt-shaped structure of steel designed to support the skirts of a woman\u2019s dress into the required shape. In form and function it is very similar to the earlier farthingale.\n\nThe name Crinoline was invented by one of the fabric's manufacturers, who combined the Latin words crinis (meaning hair) and lin (meaning flax). An alternative origin for the word is sometimes given: the combination of the French words crin (specifically meaning horse-hair) and lin (again, meaning flax).\n\nThe crinoline was not the first accessory designed to support the wearer's skirts in the correct shape; the farthingale in its various forms was worn from the late fifteenth century through the early seventeenth century, and panniers in the eighteenth century. However, these very formal and elaborate styles were only worn at royal courts and in the highest levels of society.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, French fashion turned against the elaborate styles favoured by royalty, the court, and the aristocracy. As Parisian fashion was very influential, most western European countries adopted the same styles.\n\nUnder the prevailing neoclassical influence, women\u2019s fashions had adopted a simple style based on the simple draped garments of Ancient Greece and the togas of ancient Rome. Skirts were straight and slender, and worn with very few \u2014 if any \u2014 petticoats.\n\nHowever, the silhouette did not remain that way for long, and skirt hems began to widen to give a cone shape. In the 1810s, gores began to be used in skirts again, and skirts grew wider in the 1820s. The width of these skirts was sometimes supported by a small bustle. These were not always sufficient, and so extra petticoats were worn to help.\n\nThe first Crinolines were petticoats starched for extra stiffness, or made out of the new crinoline fabric, and they often had ruffles to support the skirts to the desired width. However, dress fabrics were heavy but not stiff enough to support their own weight, which tended to collapse the petticoats out of shape. Extra rigidity was added to petticoats through rings of cord or braid running around the hem. In the 1830s, women started to wear petticoats with hoops of whalebone or cane around the hem.\n\nThe first hoop skirt in the US is from 1846, patent number 4,584 of David Hough, Jr. In 1858, IRJ Mann's US patent number 20,681 was the first latticework of strings and hoops.\n\nIn 1858, the American W.S. Thomson greatly facilitated the development of the cage crinoline by developing an eyelet fastener to connect the steel crinoline hoops with the vertical tapes descending from a band around the wearer\u2019s waist. The invention was patented in the United States (patent US21581), France (patent FR41193) and Britain (patent GB1204/1859). This facilitated the fashionable silhouette's development from a cone shape to a dome. It was not an entirely original idea; Thompson was probably inspired by the open cage or frame style of farthingales and panniers.\n\nThe cage crinoline was adopted with enthusiasm: the numerous petticoats, even the stiffened or hooped ones, were heavy, bulky and generally uncomfortable. It was light \u2014 it only required one or two petticoats worn over the top to prevent the steel bands appearing as ridges in the skirt \u2014 and freed the wearer's legs from tangling petticoats.\n\nUnlike the farthingale and panniers, the crinoline was worn by women of every social class. The wider circulation of magazines and newspapers spread news of the new fashion, also fueling desire for it, and mass production made it affordable.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"}, {"description": "Judo, or juudou in Japanese, is a modern martial art, combat and Olympic sport created in Japan in 1882. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or takedown an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms, and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice.

Common uses are anime otaku (a fan of anime), cosplay otaku and manga otaku (a fan of Japanese comic books), pasokon otaku (personal computer geeks), geemu otaku (playing video games), and wota (pronounced ota, previously referred to as idol otaku) that are extreme fans of idols, heavily promoted singing girls. There are also tetsudou otaku or denshamania (railfans) or gunji otaku (military geeks).\n\nWhile these are the most common uses, the word can be applied to anything (music otaku, martial arts otaku, cooking otaku, etc).\n\nSome of Japan's otaku use the term to describe themselves and their friends semi-humorously, accepting their position as fans, and some even use the term proudly, attempting to reclaim it from its negative connotations. In general colloquial usage however, most Japanese would consider it undesirable to be described in a serious fashion as otaku; many even consider it to be a genuine insult.\n\nThe negativity which modern society shows towards otaku and otaku culture is historically partly attributed to Miyazaki Tsutomu, who became known as The Otaku Murderer in 1989.

Additionally, these yandere girls have darker aspects of their personality that, as noted above, often goes beyond simply being cold and can turn very violent, even leading to the girl committing murder or suicide. This dark side is most of the time kept to herself and is usually the product of traumatic psychological stress experienced by the girl in her past.

Kingship is usually inherited, and rules vary from place to place, but the most common is: preference goes to the direct descendants (e.g. sons are privileged in comparison with nephews), normally by the eldest relative in a given line, and in most monarchies a male will displace a female, often even in more preferred lines (e.g. a nephew would displace an older niece and often also an elder daughter, but not a younger son)."}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "police car"}, "id": 1367, "description": "A police car is a ground vehicle used by police, to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents.

This impact on human society has given them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat. In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.\n\nMost breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviours by people for specific functional roles.

The hairstyle, and particularly its shorter, less elaborate versions, is also referred to by some as a natural, since in most cases the hair is left untreated by relaxers or straightening chemicals and is instead allowed to express its natural curl or kinkiness.\n\nIn people with naturally curly or straight hair, the hairstyle is typically created with the help of creams, gels or other solidifying liquids to hold the hair in place. Particularly popular in the African-American community of the late 1960s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "comic relief"}, "id": 1705, "description": null}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "library committee"}, "id": 1706, "description": null}, {"description": null, "image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "sleepyhead"}, "id": 1707}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "hachimaki"}, "id": 1708, "description": "A hachimaki (\u9262\u5dfb) is a stylized headband in Japanese culture, usually made of red or white cloth, worn as a symbol of perseverance or effort by the wearer.

At the time, it was the largest women's accessories manufacturer throughout New York City's garment district.\n\nThe first tube top was actually a \"mistake\", but Mr. Kleid realized this garment's potential. \"Samples\" of the tube top were immediately being dispersed to local distributors. Its positive reaction had them on shelves worldwide within a month or two after that.\n\nThe garment district of Manhattan was possibly the largest of areas in New York City overrun with organized crime. Mr. Kleid had a long history in the garment district, and used the strength he obtained in the garment district to keep any competition at bay, so for this, S & M Fringing, Inc. (which was located at 50th West 17th Street) was the sole manufacturer of tube tops for many decades.\n\nIt reached its highest level of popularity in the late 1970s. It vanished from the scene during the early- and mid-1990s, but later made a major reappearance in the wardrobes of American teenage girls and young American women, especially college-age women, after 2000, and various versions of the style have been popular ever since then.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/68931.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "boob tube"}, "id": 1840}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "club president"}, "id": 1841, "description": "Japanese schools' extra-curricular activities are centered around \"club activities\" organised by the students themselves.

It is characterised by its H-shaped horizontal hand grip, which results in the blade of the sword sitting above the user's knuckles. Unique to South Asia, it is the most famous and characteristic of Indian daggers. Ceremonial katara were also used in worship.\n\nThe katara originated in Tamil Nadu where its Dravidian name was kattari before being altered to katara in the north. The earliest forms occur in the medieval Deccan kingdom of Vijayanagara. Katara dating back to this period often had a leaf- or shell-like knuckle-guard to protect the back of the hand, but this was discarded by the latter half of the 17th century. The Maratha gauntlet sword or pata is thought to have been developed from the katara. As the weapon spread throughout India it became something of a status symbol, much like the Southeast Asian kris or the Japanese katana. Among the Rajputs, Sikhs and Mughals, princes and nobles were often portrayed wearing a katara at their side. This was not only a precaution for self-defense, but it was also meant to show their wealth and position. Upper-class Mughals would even hunt tigers with katara. For a hunter to kill a tiger with such a short-range weapon was considered the surest sign of bravery and martial skill.\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, katara were often made from broken sword-blades. Even old imported European blades were used, especially by the Maratha Empire, and were riveted to projections from the hilt. After India was colonised by the British, numerous katara were made for the European collectors' market which placed little value on functionality. Among these were the scissors katara with two or three blades that folded together, appearing to be one, until the handle bars were pressed together, when they opened out. These novelty weapons were popular among foreigners but were impractical in actual combat. For example, the blades couldn't be opened after they are thrusted into an opponent's body. More importantly, if they were wielded with the blades opened, all the force of the blow would have to be absorbed by the hinge-pins at the root of the blades.\n\nIn another modern katar design, single-shot pistols are built into either side of the weapon. In the 18th century, some traditional katara were refurbished with this innovation. The pistols are meant to deal the killing blow after the katara has been thrust into the enemy. Like most combination weapons, the effectiveness of the pistol-katar is doubtful. The katara ceased to be in common use by the 19th century, though they were still forged for decorative purposes. During the 18th century and 19th century, a distinctive group of katara were produced at Bundi in Rajasthan. They were ornately crafted and their hilts were covered in gold foil. These katara were shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Crystal Palace, London. Since then, the weapon has sometimes been mistakenly referred to in English as a Bundi dagger.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/79560.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "katara"}, "id": 1856}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "New Zealander"}, "id": 1857, "description": null}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "mean"}, "id": 1858, "description": "This character has a tendency to be unpleasant to others.

They are often found inhumed in mounded tumulus graves as offerings to deities. They continued to be popular with the ruling elites throughout the Kofun Period of Japan, and are often romanticised as indicative of the Yamato Dynasty of Japan. They are mainly made of jade, agate, quartz, talc, and jasper. Some consider them to be an Imperial symbol, although in fact ownership was widespread throughout all the chieftainships of Kofun Period Japan. It is believed that magatama were popularly worn as jewels for decoration, in addition to their religious meanings. In this latter regard they were later largely replaced by Buddhist prayer beads in the Nara period. In modern Japan, the magatama's shape of a sphere with a flowing tail is a common visual representation of the human spirit.\n\nThe most important magatama is the Yasakani no Magatama, which is part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan, added some time around the Heian period. The Yasakani no Magatama stands for benevolence, and is one of the three items used in the ceremony of imperial ascension. In Japanese mythology, the jewels, along with the mirror, were hung on the tree outside of Amaterasu's cave to lure her out. It is believed to be a necklace composed of jade magatama stones instead of a solitary gem as depicted in popular culture. It is believed to be enshrined in Kokyo, the Japanese Imperial Palace.\n\nThe consensus among Japanese archaeologists is that magatama originated in Joumon Japan before spreading to the Asian continent through the Korean peninsula. It is claimed that the earliest Korean prehistoric magatama date to the Early Mumun (post-850 BC) and are generally found in the southern part of peninsula in proximity to Japan. Charles Keally, an archaeologist who has conducted research on magatama, states: The magatama's origins are more controversial. These curved jewels of jadeite are common in Kofun Period burials, and they are common also in Korean sites of the same age. But magatama are found in Yayoi sites, too, and unquestionable true magatama are reported also in Jomon sites in Tohoku as early as about 1000 B.C., long before true magatama appeared in Korea. The magatama is found also on early Korean royal gold crowns and has long been considered a sign of royalty in Korea as well as being a connection with Shamanistic elements.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"}, {"description": null, "image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "aide-de-camp"}, "id": 208}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "hosome"}, "id": 2080, "description": "Hosome (\u7d30\u76ee) literally means narrow eyes.

False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often included. It peaked in popularity around the year 2000. The Shibuya and Ikebukuro districts of Tokyo were the centres of Ganguro fashion.\n\nGanguro appeared as a new fashion style in Japan in the early 1990s and to date is prevalent mostly among young women. In Ganguro fashion, a deep tan is combined with hair dyed in shades of orange to blonde, or a silver grey known as \"high bleached\". Black ink is used as eye-liner and white concealer is used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often added to this. Platform shoes and brightly-coloured outfits complete the ganguro look. Also typical of Ganguro fashion are tie-dyed sarongs, miniskirts, stickers on the face, and many bracelets, rings, and necklaces.\n\nGanguro falls into the larger subculture of Gyaru (from English \"gal\"), a slang term used for various groups of young women, usually referring to overly childish or rebellious girls. Researchers in the field of Japanese studies believe that Ganguro is a form of revenge against traditional Japanese society due to resentment of neglect, isolation, and constraint of Japanese society. This is their attempt at individuality, self-expression, and freedom, in open defiance of school standards and regulations. Fashion magazines like Egg and Ageha have had a direct influence on the Ganguro. Other popular Ganguro magazines include Popteen and Ego System. The Ganguro culture is often linked with para para, a Japanese dance style. However, most para para dancers are not Ganguro, and most Ganguro are not para para dancers, though there are many who are Ganguro or Gal and dance para para.\n\nOne of the most famous early Ganguro girls was known as Buriteri, nicknamed after the black soy sauce used to flavor yellowtail fish in teriyaki cooking. Egg made her a star by frequently featuring her in its pages during the height of the Ganguro craze. After modelling and advertising for the Shibuya tanning salon \"Blacky\", social pressure and negative press convinced Buriteri to retire from the Ganguro lifestyle."}, {"description": null, "image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "maid dress"}, "id": 2108}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "genius"}, "id": 2109, "description": "A genius is someone possessing extraordinary intelligence or skill, normally to a degree associated with the achievement of unprecedented insight, and especially when demonstrated through a creative or original work in a field of human knowledge.

Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\n\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, many speedcubers continue to practise it and other twisty puzzles and compete for the fastest times.

Halacy's Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a \"new frontier\" that was \"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' -a bridge...between mind and matter.\" The cyborg is often seen today merely as an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology, but this perhaps oversimplifies the category of feedback.\n\nFictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts, and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality, free will, and empathy. Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g. the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek); or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g. the \"Human\" Cylons from the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica). The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs. Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will. Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).\n\nReal (as opposed to fictional) cyborgs are more frequently people who use cybernetic technology to repair or overcome the physical and mental constraints of their bodies.

The bokken were used in feudal Japan to train samurai, and to this day are used in martial arts. A bokken will usually be shaped after a katana, but other swords, such as the wakizashi or the tantou, may serve as models as well. When compared to its metallic counterpart, a bokken requires much less care and maintenance. Some bokken may also be used for ornamental purposes.\n\nDue to the use seen by the bokken, its wood should fulfill a set of desired qualities. The wood must be heavy, in order to inflict the most damage; it must be rigid, in order to not bend or crumple; and it must be sturdy, so as to not shatter or fracture. As such, it has to be preferentially made of high-quality hardwood, which is rare, expensive, and often protected by law. As such, most mass-produced bokken are made of cheap softwood, and thus tend to quickly become full of dents or simply break with just as much as moderately heavy impacts.\n\nAlthough the bokken mitigates the risks associated with metallic edged swords, such as that of piercing vital areas, it is still a very dangerous blunt weapon on its own right; the damage inflicted by a meter-long wooden club may easily be enough to severely harm or even kill a human being, even more so when made of hardwood. Therefore, when sparring, it is common to, instead of the bokken, use a shinai, which is a light, flexible, and much safer bamboo sword that can hardly compare to the bokken in terms of potential damage. Indeed, legend has it that famed swordsmaster Miyamoto Musashi defeated and killed equally prominent swordsman Sasaki Kojirou in a duel using only a bokken he himself had carved; according to legend, Miyamoto smashed Kojirou's ribs with a strike powerful enough to cause the latter to fall down while puncturing his lungs and killing him.", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/81663.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "bokken"}, "id": 2232}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "long ears"}, "id": 2233, "description": null}, {"description": "Weather forecasters, also called weather reporters or weathercasters, report current and forecasted weather conditions.

The Empire was originally forged as its precursor, the Galactic Federation, decayed and its people looked for a hero-like politician to guide them; Rudolf, who was a very charismatic leader, fit the bill perfectly, and was also very power-hungry; he jumped at the opportunity, took all power into his hands, dissolved the Federation into a new Empire, and named himself the Kaiser. Eventually, refugees under the leadership of Ale Heinessen would flee the oppression and form what became known as the Free Planets Alliance, but the Alliance was discovered and attacked as rebels, and subsequently waged a seemingly endless war to a stalemate. As one might expect, nobles can be either born with that status or granted it, and that one of the lead characters would be made into a noble is a key plot point in the story.\n\nAfter almost 160 years of war and many centuries of bad government, Reinhard von Lohengramm would take advantage of his military prowess to garner allies and power, even more so during the civil war that followed the death of Kaiser Friedrich IV. Soon afterwards, Reinhard would use that power in his favor to depose the Goldenbaum dynasty entirely, seizing power to himself and thus founding the Lohengramm Dynasty, also referred to as the New Galactic Empire. Under Reinhard's leadership, the Empire would undergo drastic reforms; he revoked the privileges of nobles, seized control of the then-autonomous planet Phezzan, moved the government to it, started a new calendar, and did many other things that caused the horror of the former aristocracy, causing many nobles to unsuccessfully try to stop him. He soon also conquered the Alliance and imposed a harsh peace treaty, and after a revolt also annexed it altogether. After his death, his wife Hildegard von Mariendorf would lead the Galactic Empire into maturity, eventually changing it into a constitutional monarchy, as his highly respected, long-time rival, Alliance admiral Yang Wen-li would have argued for.Show Spoiler", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/59406.png", "titles": {"canonical": "Galactic Empire"}, "id": 2362}, {"description": "Is a description of someone who has difficulty changing opinions.

A person who participates in archery is typically known as an archer.\n\nWhile archery has been historically used for hunting, both for food and later, in a use that survives to this day, also as a sport, through most of pre-gunpowder human history its main use was for combat; archers were extremely important in warfare, in open field and siege alike, due to their ability to massively kill enemy armies with literal rains of arrows and to set things aflame with burning arrowheads. Proper easy of burning arrowheads could destroy the morale of an invading infantry division or set the entire defending fortress on fire, while non-burning arrowheads could destroy a large portion of the enemy infantry before it could even enter melee combat. Such was the destruction ability of archers that horse archers were the backbone of the both the Hun and Mongol hordes; the former brought terror to and helped the eventual demise of the Roman Empire, while the latter conquered such a large portion of Eurasia that historians coined the term Pax Mongolica (paralleling the Pax Romana) to describe their empire that at its apex spanned from modern-day Poland to the Middle East to Southern China, Korea and the southern parts of Russia.\n\nWith the discovery of gunpowder and the invention of firearms, archery was quickly rendered obsolete in warfare. Early firearms were not good in comparison to good archers, with drawbacks such as a vastly inferior rate of fire and high susceptibility to wet weather; nevertheless, they had longer effective range and, most importantly, required almost no practice to use properly in comparison to the many years that it took to train an archer; indeed, a popular saying used to go that \"to make a good archer, one must start with his grandfather\". Nevertheless, in the Far East archery is to this day considered an important subject in the studies of martial arts, and some Japanese schools have archery dojos ran by archery clubs.

The inverse scenario, where a modest and loving person becomes conceited/irritable/violent, is also a tsundere.\n\nThe default state does not matter. The character can default to \"tsuntsun\" or \"deredere\"; the key concept is the fact that there's a (generally very quick) flip from one mode to the other.\n\nIt can also describe a contradictory personality which is good-willed on the inside, but with a harsh attitude on the outside. Originally found in Japanese bishoujo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.\n\nTsundere is a portmanteau of the two words tsuntsun (\u30c4\u30f3\u30c4\u30f3), and deredere (\u30c7\u30ec\u30c7\u30ec). Tsuntsun is defined as \"aloof, morose, pointed\", and deredere is defined as \"exhausted, lovestruck\". Tsunderekko (\u30c4\u30f3\u30c7\u30ec\u3063\u5a18) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait. The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.'s portable television set), and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in Lucky Star's Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness. Another accepted definition of tsundere is a girl who has a combative attitude toward others but is also kind on the inside. She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him and sometimes even falls in love with him.", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/30388.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "tsundere"}, "id": 2455}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "ki manipulation"}, "id": 2456, "description": "There is an energy residing within everything, called ki.

It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.\n\nThese terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.\n\nNovels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician's Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.\n\nContemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.\n\nIn his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about \"magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels\", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: \"I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales\". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.\n\nSource: wiki"}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "dark fantasy"}, "id": 2649, "description": "Focus set on darker themes in a fantasy setting, sometimes leaning towards horror elements.

In a state of \"total war,\" the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.

Many countries were already at war before this date, such as Ethiopia and Italy in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and China and Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many who were not initially involved joined the war later, as a result of events such as the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and British colonies, and subsequent declarations of war on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and British Commonwealth.\n\nIn 1945, the war ended in a victory for the Allies.

The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person's genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.\n\nPeople, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\n\nThough the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\n\nNudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\n\nEspecially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\n\nSource: wiki"}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "violence"}, "id": 2750, "description": "Physical force against self or other, compelling action against one's will on pain of being hurt."}, {"description": "Combat involves a violent conflict with the goal to establish dominance over an opponent.", "image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "combat"}, "id": 2751}, {"description": "Tennis is yet another sport involving hitting a ball.

When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it's safe to assume you're watching ecchi.\n\nThe word \"ecchi\" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a \"milder\" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term \"ecchi\" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter \"H\" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as \u30a8\u30c3\u30c1, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as \"ecchi\" or \"etchi\". It is not, as many believe, short for \"hentai\" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as \"hentai\".\n\nThe line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn't hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB's purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.\n\nSource: TV Tropes"}, {"description": "Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics to non-human beings, inanimate objects, or natural or supernatural phenomena.

Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a \"reverse harem\", or sometimes also \"male harem\". Aside from the swapping of the characters' genders, the trope's details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters' age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.\n\nAs a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters' looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead's part pretty much can't be avoided, and it's typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.\n\nMost of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called \"harem ending\".", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/94602.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "harem"}, "id": 2859}, {"description": "Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii or Testudines characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield.\r\n\nSource: Wikipedia \n\nNote that this tag includes both land-dwelling (tortoises) and water-dwelling turtles.", "image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "turtle"}, "id": 286}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "cyberpunk"}, "id": 2861, "description": "Cyberpunk focuses on computers or information technology, usually coupled with some degree of breakdown in social order.

Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.\n\nThis is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.\n\nIn many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one's own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.\n\nSource: TVTRope", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/169641.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "important haircut"}, "id": 3092}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "befriend attack"}, "id": 3094, "description": "One character practically \"pounces a hug\" on another character.\n\nUsed as comedy element (slapstick) to demonstrate the exuberant affection of the (usually female) \"pouncing\" protagonist."}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "underwater"}, "id": 3097, "description": "Underwater is a term describing the realm below the surface of water where the water exists in a natural feature such as an ocean, sea, lake, pond, or river."}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "jobs"}, "id": 31, "description": "A job is an economic role for which a person is paid.\n\nSource: Wiktionary"}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "bear"}, "id": 310, "description": null}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "lottery wheel"}, "id": 3101, "description": "One of the protagonists plays the lottery wheel in some shopping mall and \u2014 as fate will have it \u2014 wins a prize, e.g. a visit to the local hot springs or water park.

There's always going to be a shadier, nastier way of doing business, and that will almost certainly follow humanity to the stars. Thus, sci-fi authors will include Expies of modern and historic (un)organized crime\u2014be they space mafia, gangs, or\u2014in our case\u2014pirates.\n\nIt's not as anachronistic as it might seem. After all, pirates themselves have made a Real Life comeback in Somalia, and it's a lucrative enough \"business\" that it's taken a multinational military response to fight back. Surely an established society in outer space with significant trade and commerce would suffer similar problems!\n\n... Well, maybe. The major problem with space pirates preying on space commerce is that space is vast. The challenge of catching commercial shipping in open space is orders of magnitudes more difficult than catching them on the open seas. Sometimes, this is cleverly worked around and justified. Most of the time, however, it isn't.\n\nThere are two kinds of Space Pirates in science fiction. The normal version are violent criminals with a spaceship, who attack other spaceships, just like present-day pirates. Once you have shipping between different solar systems/planets, pirates preying on said shipping are bound to show. Simple as that. Done this way, piracy actually makes sense, provided there's an enabling factor. That could be anything from the technology of the setting creating trade lanes (via a Portal Network, predictable Faster Than Light Travel routes thanks to Negative Space Wedgies, or timed space flights between planets to reduce time spent between planets, as in Real Life), to using a variant of the method employed by modern pirates (say, smaller ships striking at commercial shipping in the orbit of a planet).\n\nThe other version does a Recycled In SPACE on every eighteenth century pirate cliche ever. Reasons for including this version will typically be along the lines of \"Because Space Is An Ocean, it has to have Pirates\" rather than making any meaningful attempt at justifying their existence. They have Cornish accents, beards, say \"Arr!\" a lot, have parrots (probably robot) and false limbs (probably cybernetic) and wear tricorn hats and eyepatches (or have cybernetic eyes). They may even have ships shaped like boats.\n\nOne of the best known space pirates is Captain Harlock from the same named popular TV anime series.\n\nSource: TV Tropes"}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "glowing eyes"}, "id": 331, "description": null}, {"image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/64170.png", "titles": {"canonical": "evolution"}, "id": 3313, "description": "Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.

Thus, over the years it became a norm to invest more time and money into the first and last episode, leaving many episodes in the middle to stand severe budget restrictions. This sometimes results in episodes which particularly stand out due to the drop in artwork or animation quality; bar some basic framework, they often have little in common with the rest of the series.\n\nOne clue to upcoming off-model animation is the noticeable addition of many Korean names in the production credits, as farming out more animation to Korean artists is a nearly universal indicator of a production company trying to save money in all possible ways.\n\nThis effect is often called yashigani, after the infamous fourth episode of Lost Universe, Yashigani Hoburu. Another prominent term describing the same effect is \"QUALITY animation\", with capital letters meant to show contrast to actual quality. Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Crescent Love is another legendarily terrible offender: the TV airing of its third episode had a perfectly spherical ball in place of what should be a cabbage; the \"cabbage\" was so egregious that it became closely associated with the anime itself, to a point the show would henceforth be nicknamed \"Cabbage Love\" among Western viewers.\n\nOne should not confuse the yashigani effect with art shifts that stem from guest staff, changes in main staff, intentional art shifts, and similar effects. Another effect one shouldn't confuse this one with is the so-called DVD/BD enhancement, which is when a studio scrambles to meet the deadline for a TV airing and airs a half-finished episode but eventually fixes it for a disk release; for example, Shaft is particularly infamous for its disk enhancements, to a point it has become known as \"Shafting\", and they prominently feature intentionally weird character models, but they don't often leave bad artwork on the disk release.

Stories revolving around scientific and technical consistency were written as early as 1860s and 1870s; Jules Verne is generally considered the creator of the genre. Although not always accurate in his scientific depictions, and though Verne himself denied writing as a scientist or seriously predicting machines and technology of the future, the attention to detail in his work became an inspiration for many future scientists and explorers.\n\nNowadays, the term soft science fiction is also often used to refer to science fiction stories which lack scientific focus or rigorous adherence to known science; the categorization \"hard science fiction\" thus represents a position on a broad continuum ranging from \"softer\" to \"harder\". There is a degree of flexibility in how far from \"real science\" a story can stray before it leaves the realm of hard science fiction; some authors scrupulously avoid such technology as faster-than-light travel, while others accept such notions but focus on realistically depicting the worlds that such a technology might make possible. In this view, a story's scientific \"hardness\" is less a matter of the absolute accuracy of the science content than of the rigour and consistency with which the various ideas and possibilities are worked out.

The early civilizations in recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, and Maya performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.\n\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.

Frosts, if a normal part of winter, become less severe. In climates that have no snow and rare frosts, the air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly. Many flowering plants bloom this time of year, in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground, continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas spring may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries and quince, or August (Southern Hemisphere) in the same way.

The term HIV/AIDS represents the entire range of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as AIDS.\n\nHIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.\n\nGenetic research indicates that HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause\u2014HIV infection\u2014was identified in the early part of the decade. Since its discovery, AIDS has caused an estimated 36 million deaths worldwide (as of 2012). As of 2012, approximately 35.3 million people are living with HIV globally. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic\u2014a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.\n\nHIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has significant economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has also become subject to many controversies involving religion.

Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial retribution, which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and vengeful. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully.

It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya-hime, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant by a bamboo cutter, alongside riches in gold. The thumb-sized girl grew into a beautiful woman, and this was known all over the lands. Eventually 5 princes made their way to her to ask her foster father for her hand. Each of them got tasked with something seemingly impossible to fullfil to marry her. After all of them failed, the emporer came to see her, and fell for her beauty. His proposal was denied as well, telling him that she wasn't of this country and thus couldn't marry him. In the summer Kaguya-hime started to cry upon seeing the full moon. Her foster parents inquired on the matter and after a while she gave in, telling them that she was actually coming from the moon, and that she needs to return there. When the day came to return, the emperor sent many guards to her home to protect her from the moon people. They came and took her with them anyway, leaving the parents in sadness and tears. The heartbroken emperor wanted to send her a message, and went on to ask where he could find the closest place to heaven. This being the Great Mountain of Suruga Provice. The tale goes on saying that the name of the mountain, which we know today as Mount Fuji, came from the word immortality (fushi, or fuji), and the Kanji from the emperor's army ascending its slopes, meaning literally \"Mountain Abounding with Warriours\" (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71).\n\nThe anime or episode either takes on the whole tale of Kaguya-hime or just parts of it."}, {"image": null, "titles": {"canonical": "lab manager"}, "id": 6354, "description": null}, {"description": "Sexual acts taking place in water: i.e. sea, pool, bath, shower, etc.", "restricted": "yes", "image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/178296.jpg", "titles": {"canonical": "water sex"}, "id": 6355}, {"description": "The platypus is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.

The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and accounts from the 17th century. Because these vary considerably, and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact appearance in life remains unresolved. Similarly, little is known with certainty about its habitat and behaviour. In the picture, a 1905 illustration by lepidopterist and zoological artist Frederick William Frohawk published in Lionel Walter Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds.\n\nThe dodo became extinct very quickly, likely in about or less than a century since its first recorded mention in 1598; its last widely accepted sighting happened in 1662, but it was already very rare by the mid-17th century. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery would only be accepted in the 19th century, but it called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in Alice in Wonderland, and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence.

A penile erection is the hydraulic effect of blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis. The process is most often initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the penis. The most important organic causes are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma from prostatectomy surgery), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.\n\nPsychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but can often be helped. Notably in psychological impotence, there is a strong response to placebo treatment. Erectile dysfunction can have severe psychological consequences as it can be tied to relationship difficulties and masculine self-image.\n\nBesides treating the underlying causes such as potassium deficiency or arsenic contamination of drinking water, the first line treatment of erectile dysfunction consists of a trial of PDE5 inhibitor drugs (the first of which was sildenafil or Viagra). In some cases, treatment can involve prostaglandin tablets in the urethra, injections into the penis, a penile prosthesis, a penis pump or vascular reconstructive surgery.\n\nThe Latin term impotentia coeundi describes simple inability to insert the penis into the vagina; it is now mostly replaced by more precise terms, such as erectile dysfunction.

A philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"}, {"image": "http://img7.anidb.net/pics/anime/10394.jpeg", "titles": {"canonical": "guimpe"}, "id": 6754, "description": "A guimpe is a linen cloth, often starched, which covers the neck and shoulders of the wearer, sometimes the entire chest as well.

The term hikikomori refers to both the sociological phenomenon in general as well as to people belonging to this societal group. In Western terminology this group may include individuals suffering from social phobia or social anxiety problems. This could also be due to agoraphobia, avoidant personality disorder or painful or extreme shyness. There are also Hikikomoris who may choose this lifestyle for purely cultural reasons.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare defines hikikomori as people who refuse to leave their house, and isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months. While the degree of the phenomenon varies on an individual basis, in the most extreme cases, some people remain in isolation for years or even decades. Often hikikomori start out as school refusals, or futoukou (\u4e0d\u767b\u6821) in Japanese (an older term is toukoukyohi (\u767b\u6821\u62d2\u5426)).\n\nWhile many people feel the pressures of the outside world, hikikomori react by complete social withdrawal. In some cases, they lock themselves in a room for prolonged periods, sometimes measured in years. They usually have few, if any, friends.\n\nWhile hikikomori favor indoor activities, some venture outdoors on occasion. The withdrawal from society usually starts gradually. Affected people may appear unhappy, lose their friends, become insecure, shy, and talk less.\n\nHikikomori tend to be financially supported by their parents, or by receiving social assistance.
